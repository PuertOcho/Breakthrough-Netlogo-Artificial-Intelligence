---------------------------------WHAT IS IT?------------- --------------------
Great Advance is an abstract strategy game invented by Dan Troyka in 2000. In 2001
He won the 8x8 Game Design Competition and has some similarity with the ladies, but the strategy
It is completely different.
It is played on an 8x8 square board with black and white tiles.
The objective of the game is to reach the main row of the opponent - the furthest from
of the player. This means that the white player must reach the eighth row and that the black must
Reach the front row to win the game.
Each player moves one piece per turn. A token can be moved one square forward or
diagonally as long as the destination box is free. A token can also be moved to
a square occupied by another of the rival as long as there is a square in front diagonally.
The game ends if one of the players reaches the main row of the opponent.
